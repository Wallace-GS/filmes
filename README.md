# Filmes

![logo](./filmes.png)

Have you ever felt that you have several movies you wanted to watch but when it comes down to actually picking a movie you draw a blank? Sometimes it can be because there's just so many to choose from and sometimes it's because you just don't know what you're in the mood for. Well my family has had this problem, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Half of my family lives thousands of miles away but we still enjoy picking out movies every so often to watch and discuss. This webapp was made to help us keep track of what movies we currently have in our backlog, that way we can spend more time actually watching a movie and less time arguing what movie we should watch this time around.

I'd like to keep my family's backlog private and immutable by outside parties so to demonstrate the webapp I have deployed it to the following heroku address:

Feel free to register, add movies, and fiddle. Please keep it PG-13 as I have not added a language filter yet.
